# CommandTransparency
A plugin that announces commands executed by your staff, so the community knows if any abuse is happening.

Commands

/ToggleCT
/TCT -- Both commands toggle the command transparency.

Permisisons

CommandTransparency.ToggleCT -- Allows user to execute the command to toggle command transparency.
CommandTransparency.TransparentCommands -- Anyone with this permission will have their commands transparent, unless the command they execute are ignored, or the plugin is toggled.

Note: Blue hammers automatically have the CommandTransparency.TransparentCommands permission.
